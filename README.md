## Correlation analysis scripts Tien Shan / Pamir glacier mass balance drivers

Scripts for the workflow explained in the TC paper **"Central Asiaâ€™s spatiotemporal glacier response ambiguity due to data inconsistencies and regional simplifications"** (https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1343-2023).

Data files are available on a zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6631963).


To reproduce the analysis, download the files (zenodo). Define the working path `mnt` in each script and make sure you have all files in the subfolder `data`. Files and subfolders should be placed into data. Add the individual output folders with names indicated in the scripts.
